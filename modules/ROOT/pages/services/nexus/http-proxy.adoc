This section will guide the user through setting up an HTTP/HTTPS proxy in Nexus.

== Use Case

Setting up an HTTP/HTTPS proxy is useful when setting up mirrors in Nexus behind a firewall or in an air gap environment.

== Prerequisites

* Nexus is up and running
* The Nexus GUI is accessible (e.g. http://my-management-vm/nexus)
* The Nexus administrator credentials (default: `admin:admin123`)
* A proxy URL (IP or hostname) and port

== Steps

NOTE: This can only be done via a GUI, Nexus3 does not support modifying this option with their REST API.

. Visit the Nexus GUI (e.g. http://my-management-vm/nexus)

. Place a check in either HTTP proxy, HTTPS proxy, or both. If the proxy IP/URL given by the network administrator is `http`, check _both_ HTTP and HTTPS proxy and fill them in the same way.
. Fill in the URL and Port for each proxy enabled in the previous step.

Nexus is now configured to send HTTP/HTTPS traffic through the defined proxies.
