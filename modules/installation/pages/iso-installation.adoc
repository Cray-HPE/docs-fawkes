[#uefi-boot]
== UEFI Boot

WARNING: Only UEFI mode is supported. Legacy BIOS mode may work, but it is strongly recommended to use UEFI mode
instead.

. Boot the server and enter the boot menu selection screen, in the example below the boot menu selection screen is entered
by pressing kbd:[F6]. On some servers this could be another function key.
+

. Select the USB flash drive that was inserted.

. A GRUB screen should display next, either wait for the timer to run out or press kbd:[Enter] to move forward.
+

. After booting, the login prompt should be presented
+
[source,bash]
----
fawkes-live login:
----
. Login as `root` with a blank password, the system will immediately prompt for the password to be changed/set.
+
NOTE: This will only set the password for the LiveCD  `root` account, this does not carry over to the booted Hypervisor image.

You are required to change your password immediately (administrator enforced)
Changing password for root.

CRAY-HPE Fawkes LiveCD
----

== Pre-installation

These steps will be carried out on the LiveCD for preparing the Fawkes installation.

=== Prerequisites

- A network with an active DHCP server or a known static IP address
- `ssh-copy-id`

=== Network access

This segment is necessary for installing <<ssh-keys>> into the server.

. Setup `udev` rules
+
[source,bash]
----
crucible network udev
----
. Set up network access
- Using DHCP
+
[source,bash]
----
crucible network interface --dhcp lan0
----
- Using a static IP
+
NOTE: Optionally set a DNS server by appending `--dns <server IP>`, additional servers may be specified using a comma delimited list (e.g. `--dns <server IP N>,<server IP N+1>`) .
+
[source,bash]
----
crucible network interface lan0 A.B.C.D/E
----
. Exit the console, or leave it open and move to a new terminal session on a trusted workstation. Proceed to the <<ssh-keys>> section.

[#ssh-keys]
=== SSH Key(s)

The <<ssh-keys>> segment segment must be performed on a trusted workstation with connectivity to the Fawkes cluster.

IMPORTANT: *Do not perform this segment on the LiveCD* or you will lock yourself out of the the hypervisor.

. Generate or provide one or more SSH public keys.
+
NOTE: Fawkes recommends generating an EdDSA (`ed25519`) key-pair, but other ciphers such as RSA are acceptable. The guide below uses `ed25519`.
+
CAUTION: *DO NOT PASTE A PRIVATE KEY INTO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING WINDOWS*. The contents should come from
a file with a `.pub` suffix, this is the *public key*. Pasting the private key can compromise that key and prevent login after the disk installation completes.
+
Generate a key on a trusted workstation, and copy/paste a public key into a new file:
+
- With a passphrase:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
----
+
- Without a passphrase:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -N ''
----
. Optionally import the key to make the subsequent steps passwordless, otherwise proceed to the next step.
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh-import-id root@A.B.C.D
----
. Copy the *public* key to the LiveCD, authenticate with the password that was set in <<uefi-boot>> if the passwordless SSH step was not completed.
+
[source,bash]
----
scp -p <path/to/key>.pub root@A.B.C.D:/root/.ssh/
----

== Installation

This segment will wipe the server and install the hypervisor image to disk.

. Return to the previous console session, or start a new SSH session.
. Wipe the server.
+
WARNING: This will wipe all storage disks on the server with exception to USB devices.
+
[source,bash]
----
crucible storage wipe
----
. Install the OS to disk.
+
NOTE: By default all `/root/.ssh/*.pub` public keys will be installed into the hypervisor. To limit this to a single key, or to use a different directory, pass `-s </path/to/keys>`  when invoking `crucible`.
+
[source,bash]
----
crucible install
----
. Reboot to disk
+
TIP: At this time the hypervisor does have a password login similar to the LiveCD. Entering a blank password will prompt you to create a new password. This is only allowed during prototyping, and will be removed in an upcoming alpha release.

The install will have also copied all the data from `/data` to a `/vms/assets` directory. This directory is available once the hypervisor has booted.
