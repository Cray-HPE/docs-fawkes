= Installation

This module will guide a user through the installation of the Fawkes project on bare-metal.

This entails:

* Booting live media via a USB or RemoteISO
* Installing the Hypervisor OS and rebooting
* Launching the Management VM
* Discovering additional servers to use as hypervisors and storage nodes
* Deploying the additional servers
* Launching the Kubernetes virtual machines and the physical storage cluster

== Crucible

xref:crucible::index.adoc[Crucible] is a proof-of-concept application currently written in Python for facilitating
the installation of Fawkes.

It is currently limited as far as configuration goes.

Crucible is being rewritten in Go, and in that rewrite there will be more versatile configuration/inputs available.
