= USB Creation
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

This guide walks the user through setting up a bootable USB for bootstrapping the Fawkes cluster.

NOTE: Users can also remotely mount the ISO using a BMC, but at this time a guide for doing so does not exist.

== Downloading

The Fawkes tarball needs to be downloaded.

NOTE: For the time being, the artifacts are downloaded individually and from a private mirror.
In the near future these will be available in a single artifact from a public mirror.

=== Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are necessary for completing this guide.

* `curl`

NOTE: Windows users can download link:https://curl.se/windows/[`curl` for Windows].

=== Downloading the Fawkes tarball

Fawkes is only available from a private mirror at this time.

Using the private mirror requires credentials to https://artifactory.algol60.net. For information on obtaining these, see link:https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/Downloading-from-Private-Repos-in-Artifactory-eb4f579cdf9a4ea8988e402a18008b7b[this guide].

. Set Credentials
* Username and token (see link:https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/Downloading-from-Private-Repos-in-Artifactory-eb4f579cdf9a4ea8988e402a18008b7b[this guide] for assistance).
+
[source,bash]
----
ARTIFACTORY_USER=
----
+
[source,bash]
----
read -s ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN
----
. Set a desired release.
* A specific release.
+
[source,bash]
----
RELEASE=0.0.1-alpha.3
----
* The latest release from stable or unstable
+
NOTE: At this time, Fawkes is still in a pre-release state and the stable stream is empty.
+
[source,bash]
----
STREAM=unstable
RELEASE="$(curl -u "${ARTIFACTORY_USER}":"${ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN}" "https://artifactory.algol60.net/artifactoy/api/search/latestVersion?g=${STREAM}&a=fawkes")"
----
. Download the tarball
+
NOTE: To use a proxy, add `--proxy http://example.com:443` to each `curl` call.
+
[source,bash]
----
if [[ "$RELEASE" =~ ^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    STREAM=stable
else
    STREAM=unstable
fi
curl -C - -o "fawkes-${RELEASE}.tar.gz" \
"https://$ARTIFACTORY_USER:$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN@artifactory.algol60.net/artifactory/fawkes-releases/${STREAM}/fawkes/${RELEASE}/fawkes-${RELEASE}.tar.gz"

== Creating the USB

This segment will walk the user through creating the USB with the downloaded tarball.

=== Linux

The Linux method will enable persistence as well as data storage for bringing artifacts into the booted LiveCD.

==== Prerequisites

Prerequisites for creating the USB from a Linux box.

* `blkid`
* `dd`
* `mktemp`
* `parted`
* `sgdisk`
* `sha256sum`

==== Steps

The following steps will create a USB from a Linux OS.

. Extract all images and RPMs from the tarball.
+
[source,bash]
----
tar --wildcards -xzvf ./fawkes-${RELEASE}.tar.gz \
    "*/images/" \
    "*/rpm/"
----
. Validate the image's SHA sums
+
[source,bash]
----
for image_dir in fawkes-${RELEASE}/images/*; do
    (
    cd "$image_dir"
    sha256sum -c ./"$(basename "$image_dir")"*sha256.txt
    )
done
----
All the images should return with `OK`. If any fail, please stop and open a bug by using the bug opening tab on the bottom right of this screen.
. Install Crucible
+
NOTE: `crucible` is undergoing source code changes and will have packages for `yum` and `debian` package managers in the near future.
+
* SUSE
+
[source,bash]
----
zypper --plus-repo "fawkes-${RELEASE}/rpm/sle-$(awk -F= '/VERSION=/{gsub(/["-]/, "") ; print tolower($NF)}' /etc/os-release)" in -n crucible
----
. Find the desired USB drive.
+
NOTE: The target device does not need to be wiped.
+
* The following command will help deduce which device mapper name to use.
+
[source,bash]
----
lsblk -b -l -d -o SIZE,NAME,TYPE,SUBSYSTEMS | grep usb
----
* Set the USB device to a variable.
** Device mapper path.
+
[source,bash]
----
USB=/dev/sdd
----
** FileSystem Label.
+
[source,bash]
----
USB=/dev/disk/by-label/MYUSB
----
. Invoke the script, optionally passing a different size (in megabytes) for the copy-on-write persistent partition.
+
[source,bash]
----
crucible storage bootable "${USB}" "fawkes-${RELEASE}/images/fawkes-live/fawkes-live-*.iso"
----
. Mount the USB and copy over our downloaded artifacts.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo mkdir -p /mnt
sudo mount "${USB}4" /mnt
sudo cp -p "fawkes-${RELEASE}.tar.gz" /mnt/
sudo umount /mnt
----
. Eject the USB drive and plug it into the server for deployment.

=== MacOS and Windows

Creating a USB from MacOS and Windows is feasible using the help of a few third-party tools.

CAUTION: The MacOS and Windows method will not enable persistence on the drive.

==== Prerequisites

This guide suggests the following third-party tools for USB creation.

- link:https://etcher.balena.io/[belanaEtcher]

==== Steps

The following steps will create a bootable USB from a MacOS or Windows machine.

NOTE: `dd` can also be used for macOS users.

. Open belanaEtcher
. Select the ISO file, the USB stick, and click Flash
. Eject the USB and insert it into the server
