== Bare-Metal Hardware

Using the instructions from your OS and your specific hardware, install a Linux-based OS.

Recommended Distros:

- SLES 15.5
- OpenSUSE Leap 15.5

Other distros will most likely work, but the commands may differ.

== Virtual Machine Host

You can use a VM as the host, but the virtualization software must support nested virtualization.

An example of the option is shown below in VMWare Fusion:
