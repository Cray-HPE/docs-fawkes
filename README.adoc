== Contribution

To contribute to this repository one may make edits to the subdirectories within the top-level `modules/` directory.

`modules/ROOT`:: This is the main module, it serves as an overview and landing page. Content seldom goes here.
`modules/installation`:: The installation module for all things installation related.

If **adding a new module**, simple create a new folder under `modules`
(following the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/module-directory-names/[Antora recommendations for module directory names])
and then update the `antora.yml` `nav` key to refer to the new module's `nav.adoc` file.
